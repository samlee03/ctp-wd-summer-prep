## Overview: Semantic HTML Structure

<Notes>
Semantic HTML is about choosing elements based on their meaning, not their appearance. This approach creates more maintainable, accessible, and SEO-friendly websites. Before writing any HTML, take time to plan your structure thoughtfully.

Think about your content's meaning and relationships. A habit card isn't just a div with some text - it's a self-contained piece of content that could stand alone, making article the perfect element. The habit name isn't just big text - it's a heading that describes the content below.

This planning phase is crucial for complex applications. Consider how screen readers will navigate your content. Think about how search engines will understand your page structure. Plan for keyboard navigation from the start. Good semantic HTML makes CSS and JavaScript easier because elements are predictable and meaningful.

The habit card example we'll build demonstrates these principles in practice. Every element choice has a reason based on meaning, not just visual design.

## Semantic Elements


```html
<!-- Poor: Using divs for everything -->
<div class="card">
  <div class="big-text">Daily Exercise</div>
  <div class="date">2024-03-15</div>
  <div>Completed 5 times this week</div>
</div>
<!-- Better: Meaningful elements -->
<article class="habit-card">
  <h2>Daily Exercise</h2>
  <time datetime="2024-03-15">March 15, 2024</time>
  <p>Completed 5 times this week</p>
</article>
```


<Notes>
Look at these two code examples side by side. The first uses generic divs for everything - it's like writing an entire essay using only the word "thing". The browser has no idea what any of this content means. Is "Daily Exercise" a title? A label? Just some text? The date is just another string of characters.

Now look at the semantic version. The article element immediately tells us this is a self-contained piece of content. The h2 establishes "Daily Exercise" as a heading in the document hierarchy. The time element with its datetime attribute provides machine-readable date information - screen readers can announce "March 15, 2024" properly, and search engines understand this is temporal data.

This isn't about being pedantic - it's about building a web that works for everyone. When a screen reader user navigates your page, they can jump between articles, scan headings, and understand the structure. Search engines can better index your content. Future developers (including yourself) can understand the intent behind each element.

The visual appearance stays the same - CSS handles that. But the underlying structure now has meaning, making your HTML a proper document rather than a collection of styled divs.

## Accessibility First

```html
<!-- Poor: No labels, no alt text -->
<img src="habit-icon.png">
<input type="text" placeholder="Habit name">
<div onclick="saveHabit()">Save</div>`

<!-- Better: Proper labels and semantics -->
<img src="habit-icon.png" alt="Exercise habit icon">
<label for="habit-name">Habit Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="habit-name" name="habit-name">
<button type="submit">Save Habit</button>

<!-- For complex interactions -->
<div role="button" 
     tabindex="0" 
     aria-label="Mark habit as complete"
     onkeypress="if(event.key === 'Enter') markComplete()">
</div>
```

<Notes>
The difference between these two examples is stark. The first version creates multiple barriers: the image is invisible to screen readers, the input field has no accessible name (placeholders disappear when typing and aren't reliably announced), and the clickable div is completely inaccessible to keyboard users.

The accessible version fixes each issue systematically. The alt text "Exercise habit icon" describes the image's purpose, not just its appearance. The label element creates a clear relationship with the input - clicking the label focuses the field, and screen readers announce "Habit Name" when the field receives focus. Using a real button element gives us keyboard accessibility, focus states, and proper semantics for free.

The ARIA example at the bottom shows how to make custom interactive elements accessible when semantic HTML isn't enough. The role="button" tells assistive technology this div acts as a button. The tabindex="0" makes it keyboard focusable. The aria-label provides an accessible name. The keypress handler ensures it works with keyboard navigation, not just mouse clicks.

Remember: semantic HTML elements like button, input, and label include accessibility features by default. Only reach for ARIA when you truly need custom behavior that semantic elements can't provide. The best accessibility is often the simplest - use the right element for the job.
