## ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways: Advanced Functions

1. **Closures** enable data privacy and stateful functions
2. **Higher-order functions** create reusable abstractions  
3. **Function composition** builds complex behavior from simple parts
4. **Pure functions** make code predictable and testable
5. **Functional patterns** lead to more maintainable code

### Bridge to Prototypes
Closures and functional patterns are powerful, but JavaScript also has an object-oriented side. Let's explore **prototypes** - JavaScript's unique inheritance model!

<Notes>
This summary reinforces the key concepts we've covered in advanced functions. Each point represents a fundamental shift in how we think about and structure JavaScript code.

Closures give us encapsulation without classes, enabling true data privacy and persistent state. This is the foundation for many patterns, from module systems to React hooks.

Higher-order functions abstract common patterns, letting us write more declarative code. Instead of writing how to iterate, we describe what transformation we want.

Function composition shows that complex behavior doesn't require complex functions. By combining simple, focused functions, we build sophisticated systems that remain maintainable.

Pure functions and immutability work together to create predictable, testable code. When functions don't have side effects and data doesn't change, reasoning about code becomes much easier.

These functional patterns aren't just academic - they're used throughout modern JavaScript applications. Understanding them is essential for working with contemporary frameworks and libraries.

The transition to prototypes acknowledges that JavaScript is multi-paradigm. While functional patterns are powerful, understanding prototypes completes our understanding of JavaScript's design.
