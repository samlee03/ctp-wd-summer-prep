## Async/Await: The Modern Way
<CodeDisplay >
  <File name="example.js">
    
```javascript
// Async/await - makes async code look synchronous
async function processHabit(habitId) {
  try {
    // await pauses execution until Promise resolves
    const habitData = await loadHabitData(habitId);
    console.log("Got habit:", habitData.name);
    
    const result = await updateHabitStreak(habitData.id);
    const saved = await saveToDatabase(result);
    
    console.log("All done!");
    return saved;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Something failed:", error);
    throw error; // Re-throw if needed
  }
}

// Usage - async functions return Promises
processHabit(123)
  .then(result => console.log("Success:", result))
  .catch(error => console.log("Failed:", error));
```

<Notes>
Async/await is the most recent addition to JavaScript's async toolkit, and it's transformed how we write asynchronous code. The beauty of async/await is that it makes async code look and behave like synchronous code, eliminating the cognitive overhead of callbacks and Promise chains.

When you mark a function as async, two things happen: it automatically returns a Promise, and you can use the await keyword inside it. The await keyword is where the magic happens - it pauses the function's execution until the Promise resolves, then returns the resolved value directly. No more .then() chains!

Notice how our error handling uses familiar try/catch blocks instead of .catch() methods. This makes async errors behave exactly like synchronous errors. If any awaited Promise rejects, execution jumps to the catch block.

One crucial point: async functions always return Promises. Even if you return a regular value, it's wrapped in a Promise. This means you can still use .then() and .catch() when calling async functions, giving you flexibility in how you handle their results. This compatibility is why async/await has become the preferred pattern - it plays nicely with existing Promise-based code while offering cleaner syntax.
