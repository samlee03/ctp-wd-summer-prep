<Notes>
This final slide crystallizes the core concepts that students need to remember long after the lesson ends. The distinction between objects and arrays is fundamental to JavaScript programming, and understanding when to use each is crucial for effective development.

**Objects are for structure and identity**. They group related properties together and create meaningful entities. When you have data that describes a single thing with multiple attributes, use an object. Objects answer the question "What is this thing and what are its properties?" A user has a name, email, and preferences. A habit has a name, category, and streak. Objects make these relationships explicit and give your data semantic meaning.

Objects also support methods, turning them into active entities that can perform actions. This is the foundation of object-oriented programming and makes objects perfect for modeling real-world entities that have both properties and behaviors.

**Arrays are for collections and sequences**. They maintain order and enable batch operations. When you have multiple items of the same type, use an array. Arrays answer the question "What collection of things do I have and what can I do with them?" A list of users, a series of daily records, a collection of habits - these are all arrays.

The power of arrays lies in their methods. map(), filter(), reduce(), and others turn complex data processing into simple, readable code. These methods are the building blocks of data analysis and the foundation of functional programming patterns.

**The combination is where the magic happens**. Real applications use arrays of objects extensively. A user has an array of habits. Each habit is an object with properties. A habit might have an array of completion dates. This nesting allows you to model complex, real-world data relationships accurately.

**The final promise - "Master these, and you can model any data structure!"** - is not hyperbole. While JavaScript has other data structures (Map, Set, etc.), objects and arrays are the workhorses of web development. Understanding their strengths, patterns, and how they work together gives students the foundation to tackle any data modeling challenge.

Students who truly grasp objects and arrays can build sophisticated applications, create clean APIs, manage complex state, and write maintainable code. These concepts are not just JavaScript features - they're thinking tools that shape how developers approach problems.
